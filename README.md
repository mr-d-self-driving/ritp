# A rapid iterative trajectory planning method

Deploy and visualize the trajectory planner in paper "[A rapid iterative trajectory planning method for automated parking through differential flatness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889024002008)". To improve the adaptability across different scenarios, slight modifications have been made to the code implementation compared to the version described in the article. And it is also used for dataset generation in paper: "[Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384)".

The iterative collision avoidance (ItCA) path planning utilizes a polynomial with Terminal Smoothing Constraints (TSC), while velocity planning is carried out using a polynomial with acceleration constraints at the start and end points. These two components are then combined to generate the final trajectory.

With appropriate parameters, the computation time is extremely fast, achieving a calculation speed of 10ms on a desktop computer. Notably, the ItCA method, employed for smoothing discrete path points, delivers outstanding control feasibility performance.

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulas

The **RITP** method involves several key mathematical formulas, especially for **path planning** and **velocity optimization**. For a detailed explanation, please refer to the paper “A rapid iterative trajectory planning method for automated parking through differential flatness”. Below are some of the key formulas employed in the method:

### 1. **Iterative Collision Avoidance (ItCA) Path Planning**

The structure of optimization problem is expressed in the following QP form:

</div>

### 2. **Velocity Planning**

To ensure the vehicle follows the planned path while respecting velocity and acceleration limits, the QP problem is modeled as:

## 🛠️ Configure

**[1/3] Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:** First, create a virtual environment using `conda` with Python 3.8, then activate it:

```
conda create -n ritp python=3.8
conda activate ritp
```

**[2/3] Install Dependencies:** Next, install all required dependencies using `pip` from the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**[3/3] Run the Script:** Finally, you can run the script to initiate the process:

```
python scripts/ritp.py
```

This will start the main functionality of the repository.
